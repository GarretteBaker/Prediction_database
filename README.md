# Prediction_database
A light-weight way of personally keeping track of your predictions. Just download the above, open the file in the command line, import the necessary libraries (all of which are at the top of `app.py`, and type `python app.py`.

# Some use notes
To update your prediction, go to `/predictions`, click on the prediction you'd like to update, and change the probability you assign it. History is kept track of, and you can see evidence of this by going to the updates section of `/predictions`. Note that this is only history about what probability you put for the forecast at different times. Not about, say, the notes, or the content of the question at different times.
